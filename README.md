# Ethernaut-Solution
The Ethernaut is a Web3/Solidity based wargame inspired from overthewire.org, played in the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Each level is a smart contract that needs to be 'hacked'.
At this repo I try to present solutions for some levels of Ethernaut that generated recently and another friends don't release complete solution and explanation for these levels.
when I am writing this repo, our friends present a lot of usefull information about levels of Ethernaut like https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/ethernaut-community-solutions/561 (levels 1-19) and etc.
